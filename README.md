## 📂 Project Structure (Files)

## 🌐Technology Stack (Technologies Used)
* ****[Solidity](https://www.soliditylang.org/)****  - The programming language for writing the Smart contracts.
* ****[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**** - used it to write, and deploy the smart contract directly in the browser first. A fastest way to get started, acting as a "no-setup" workshop for smart contract development.
* ****[Foundry(forge, cast, anvil)](https://www.getfoundry.sh/)****  - Development framework and testing suite.
* ****[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**** - Install this IDE only if you are using foundry development kit rather than "Remix IDE" which is for quick prototying.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Solidity Compiler, Version ^0.8.19 or higher.
*  `Remix IDE` or `Foundry Development Kit`

### Recommendation (For Beginners)
****NOTE (Use Remix IDE, for quick prototyping):****  You can literally just copy the main contract source code and paste it on Remix IDE and learn along side how the code works while trying to build yours as you keep building. 


## Usage 
### Building the Project (Using Remix IDE):
1. Copy the core smart contract file code `StudentRegistry.sol` to Remix IDE (a browser based IDE, for quick prototyping).
2. Create a new file for the project on your Remix IDE and paste , to learn and build along faster.
3.  And then Compile the smart contract file you have created on Remix IDE.

### Building the Project (Using Foundry Development Kit ) - only if you are good using foundry kit
1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/legendarycode3/whitelist-smart-contract
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory you created and cloned the file to:
   ```shell
      cd whitelist-smart-contract
    ```
3.   Compile the smart contract:
       `forge build`

## 📋Contract Details
### Functions:
* ****`constructor()`****:  Function that sets the owner of the contract.
* ****`addAddress(address)`****: 
* ****`removeAddress(address)`****:  Function that removes already whitelist address , done only by the contract owner.
* ****`isWhiteListed(address)`****: Function that Checks if a given address is whitelisted.

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of (Some include):

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
